## README Content: 
# Earbuds Website

This is a dynamic website designed to showcase a pair of advanced earbuds. The website features interactive components such as a model viewer, a gallery, an animated scroll effect, and customizable color options for the earbuds. It also includes sections for product details, contact, and a video player.

## Features

### 1. **Customizable Color Options**
   - Users can change the appearance of the earbuds by selecting from four different color options: Blue, Black, Red, and White.
   - The earbuds image updates dynamically based on the selected color.

### 2. **Interactive 3D Model Viewer**
   - An interactive 3D model of the earbuds is displayed using the `<model-viewer>` HTML tag.
   - The model contains clickable hotspots that show additional information about key features (e.g., sensors, silicone tips, charging, microphone).
   - Hotspots are interactive and reveal descriptions and images when hovered over.

### 3. **Gallery with Image Slider**
   - A simple gallery displays images of the earbuds in various angles.
   - Users can navigate between images using next/previous buttons or by pressing the left/right arrow keys.

### 4. **Explosive Scroll Animation**
   - A scrolling animation is triggered when the user scrolls over a designated section of the page.
   - This animation showcases an exploded view of the earbuds, with images appearing frame by frame as the user scrolls.

### 5. **Details Section**
   - A dedicated section provides detailed information about the earbuds, including their features and specifications.
   - The section includes well-styled content boxes with features such as background colors, borders, and padding to highlight specific information.

### 6. **Video Player**
   - A video showcasing the earbuds is embedded on the page using the Plyr video player.
   - The player is styled to fit the overall design of the page.

### 7. **Contact Form**
   - A contact form allows users to get in touch with the creators of the earbuds.
   - The form includes fields for the user's name, email, and message.

### 8. **Footer with Social Icons**
   - The footer contains a logo and links to social media platforms via icon buttons.
   - The social icons change color on hover to enhance user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.
  - Flexbox and Grid are used for layout and positioning.
  - Custom styles for buttons, images, and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript** for interactive functionality:
  - **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for animations (e.g., scroll-triggered animations, dynamic image transitions).
  - **model-viewer** for 3D model rendering.
  - **Plyr** for the embedded video player.
- **ScrollTrigger** for triggering animations on scroll.
- **Custom JavaScript** for interactive features like:
  - Changing the color of the earbuds image.
  - Changing gallery images based on user interaction.
  - X-ray slider to reveal internal components of the earbuds.
