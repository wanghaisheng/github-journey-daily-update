## abstracts:
This manuscript was written for the Proceedings of the ICRA 2022 in Buenos Aires. It can be divided into four parts: The first part is an introduction to the theory of monomorphism categories, including a short survey on some representation theoretic results. The second part is a summary of some recent results on monomorphism categories based on joint work with Nan Gao, Julian K\"ulshammer and Chrysostomos Psaroudakis. It also includes a new result, namely a classification of all monomorphism categories of finite type over cyclic abelian groups. The third part concerns the relationship between submodule categories and $p$-valuated abelian groups. The last part contains a proof of wildness of a certain monomorphism category, rectifying a statement in the literature.
