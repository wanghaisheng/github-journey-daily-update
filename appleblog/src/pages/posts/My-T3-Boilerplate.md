## Description
Every time i try to start a new project i have to setup the same things over and over again (and every time something decide to not work). So i decided to create a boilerplate for myself. This boilerplate is based on the [T3 Stack](https://t3.gg/) and uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a frontend framework.

## Features
- [x] [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [x] [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [x] [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/)
- [x] [TRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [x] [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [x] [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [x] [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [x] [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Getting Started

    - I used bun as a package manager, but you can use npm or yarn if you want
    - You need to have a Clerk account and a Stripe account
    - You need to have a db setup (i used mysql hosted by PlanetScale)
