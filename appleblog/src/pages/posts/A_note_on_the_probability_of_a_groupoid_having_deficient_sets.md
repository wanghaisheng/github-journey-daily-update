## abstracts:
A subset $X$ of a groupoid is said to be deficient if $|X \cdot X|\leq |X|$. It is well-known that the probability that a random groupoid has a deficient $t$-element set with $t\geq 3$ is zero. However, as conjectured in [4], we show that the probability is not zero in the case of sets of two elements and calculate the exact value. We explore some generalisations on deficient sets and their likelihoods.
## QA:
coming soon
