## abstracts:
We study identities of Lie superalgebras over a field of characteristic zero. We construct a series of examples of finite-dimensional solvable Lie superalgebras with a non-nilpotent commutator subalgebra for which PI-exponent of codimension growth exists and is an integer number.
## QA:
coming soon
