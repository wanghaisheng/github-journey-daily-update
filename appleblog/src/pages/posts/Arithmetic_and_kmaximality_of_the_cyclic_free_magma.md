## abstracts:
We survey free magmas and we explore the structure of their submagmas. By equipping the cyclic free magma with a second distributive operation we obtain a ringoid-like structure with some primitive arithmetical properties. A submagma is $k$-maximal when there are only $k-1$ submagmas between it and the free magma itself. These two tools, arithmetic and maximality, allow us to study the lattice of the submagmas of a free magma.
## QA:
