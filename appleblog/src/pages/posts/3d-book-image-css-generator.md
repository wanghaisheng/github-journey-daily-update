# 3D Book cover CSS Generator

When I was looking for a way to create an 3D image for the book I was writing, I
was disappointed to be unable to find a decent one. So I created my own:
[3D Book Image CSS Generator](https://3d-book-css.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Use the absolute URL of the cover file
- Customize parameters such as perspective, thickness, etc.
- Generate HTML & CSS to embed on your website

## Feature ideas

- Export to PNG
- Cover file upload
- Other 3D views
