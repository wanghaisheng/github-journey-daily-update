[![Test](https://github.com/elct9620/ai-gacha/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/elct9620/ai-gacha/actions/workflows/test.yml)

If you can't draw good-looking cards in a mobile game, why not try letting AI generate them for you? This project uses the [Pastel Mix](https://huggingface.co/andite/pastel-mix) anime stylization model.
