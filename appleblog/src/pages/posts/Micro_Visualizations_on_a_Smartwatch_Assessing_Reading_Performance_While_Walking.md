## abstracts:
With two studies, we assess how different walking trajectories (straight line, circular, and infinity) and speeds (2 km/h, 4 km/h, and 6 km/h) influence the accuracy and response time of participants reading micro visualizations on a smartwatch. We showed our participants common watch face micro visualizations including date, time, weather information, and four complications showing progress charts of fitness data. Our findings suggest that while walking trajectories did not significantly affect reading performance, overall walking activity, especially at high speeds, hurt reading accuracy and, to some extent, response time.
## QA:
coming soon
