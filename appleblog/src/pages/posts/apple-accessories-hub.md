## Apple Accessories Clone

<a href="https://apple-accessories.vercel.app/">Check Out My Project!</a> 

This project is a clone of Apple Accessories webpage, developed using a modern tech stack consisting of **React, Next.js, and TypeScript**. The user interface is styled with the sleek and responsive **Tailwind CSS** framework. State management is handled with **Redux**.

The project features a homepage showcasing an image carousel powered by React Slick. Additionally, it offers dedicated category pages, such as Mac, iPhone, and more, where users can explore a wide range of Apple accessories.

Users can dive into product details, choose from various color options, and add items to their shopping cart. **To mimic the shopping experience, a test card (4242 4242 4242 4242) is available for simulating payments securely.**

Use below test cards to simulate a payment, other fields can be entered freely
