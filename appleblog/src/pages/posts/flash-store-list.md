# PWA Game Gallery

Welcome to the PWA Game Gallery repository! This project is a collection of Progressive Web App (PWA) games developed and contributed by developers and enthusiasts like you. Whether you want to explore fun games or share your own creations, this gallery is the place to be.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the PWA Game Gallery [here](https://dondido.github.io/flash-store/).

## What is a PWA Game?

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that offer a native app-like experience in a web browser. PWA games leverage web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide interactive and engaging gaming experiences directly in the browser, without the need for downloads or installations.

## Adobe Flash games converted to PWA games

Part of this project is dedicated to bringing classic Flash games back to life as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) using the Ruffle emulator. We encourage developers and enthusiasts to contribute by adding more PWA games to the collection. Let's preserve the nostalgia and enjoy these games in modern browsers!

## Contribute by adding Your PWA Game

To contribute your PWA game to the gallery, follow these guidelines:

### Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have a PWA game that you'd like to add to this collection, follow these guidelines:

1. **Edit `docs/index.html`**:
   Manually edit the `docs/index.html` file to include a link to your PWA game. 

2. **Push for a Pull Request**:
   After making your changes, push your updates to your GitHub repository and create a pull request to merge your game into the main gallery.

We encourage you to submit your favorite PWA games and help grow this vibrant community. Please ensure your contributions meet these guidelines:

- **Family-Friendly Content**: Games should be suitable for all audiences and must not contain any harmful or offensive content.
  
- **Clear and Concise Entries**: Provide clear and concise information in your game entry, including the title, URL, and a screenshot or icon.
  
- **Compatibility Testing**: Test your PWA game to ensure it works smoothly on both mobile and desktop platforms.

Thank you for contributing to the PWA Game Gallery! Let's come together to celebrate the world of web-based gaming and share the joy with the global community.
