## abstracts:
Interoperability is a significant challenge in blockchain technology, hindering seamless data and service sharing across diverse blockchain networks. This study introduces Automated Gateways as a novel framework leveraging smart contracts to facilitate interoperability. Unlike existing solutions, which often require adopting new technologies or relying on external services, Automated Gateways framework is integrated directly with a blockchain's core infrastructure to enhance systems with built-in interoperability features. By implementing fine-grained access control mechanisms, smart contracts within this framework manage accessibility and authorization for cross-chain interactions and facilitate streamlining the selective sharing of services between blockchains. Our evaluation demonstrates the framework's capability to handle cross-chain interactions efficiently, significantly reduce operational complexities, and uphold transactional integrity and security across different blockchain networks. With its focus on user-friendliness, self-managed permissions, and independence from external platforms, this framework is designed to achieve broader adoption within the blockchain community.
