## abstracts:
In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Rota-Baxter family BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras, then we define the cochain complex of BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras and verify it via Maurer-Cartan methods. Next, we further introduce and study the cohomology theory of Rota-Baxter family BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras of weight $\lambda$ and show that this cohomology controls the corresponding deformations. Finally, we study abelian extensions of Rota-Baxter family BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras in terms of the second cohomology group.
