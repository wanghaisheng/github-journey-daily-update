## How to run ? ðŸš€

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm run i

# Start application
npm run dev
```
**NOTE:** The app uses environment vars, you have to rename files .env.sample to .env in both folders server and client, then complete empty vars.

## External services ðŸŒŽ
Pokemon Generator use some external services, and can't works without them.

### Instagram 
Users may upload pictures directly from their Instagram account. The app need to have credentials from Instagram API (pair key <> secret), follow this link to create one : https://www.instagram.com/developer/clients/manage

### Transloadit
Transloadit allows file processing before upload like compression, resizing, conversion, and many more. You can find more details about this service here : https://transloadit.com/

### Amazon S3
After processing files are uploaded on Amazon S3, this is a storage service. I use this service directly in Transloadit, you can set your account to handle uploading on S3 (or use any storage service if you prefer).  
**S3** : https://aws.amazon.com/fr/s3/
