## abstracts:
This paper provides two characterizations of regularity for near-vector spaces: first, by expressing them as a direct sum of vector spaces over division rings formed by distributive elements; second, by expressing their dimension in term of the dimension of these summands. These results offer new insights into the structure and properties of near-vector spaces.
## QA:
coming soon
